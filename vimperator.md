# Vimperator

**Vimperator** is a [Firefox]({{ site.data.links.firefox }}) browser extension
with strong inspiration from the [Vim]({{ site.data.links.vim }}) text editor,
with a mind towards faster and more efficient browsing.
It has similar key bindings and you could call it a modal web browser,
as key bindings differ according to which mode you are in.
For example, it has a special *Hint* mode,
where you can follow links easily with the keyboard only.
Also most functionality is available as commands,
typing `:back` will go back within the current page history,
just like hitting the back button in the toolbar.

However, Vimperator does not try to be a 100% Vim clone,
it rather brings Vim's ideas to the 21st century.
This means making use of new graphical capabilities but also of faster computers.
Furthermore, great care is taken into making its command line interface more
consistent and easier to use,
while still being a powerful extension for advanced users.

But Vimperator is more than just a simple command interface to Firefox —
it is a complete development environment as well.
If you are a web developer, you can enjoy an interactive JavaScript shell —
even with completion support.
Or if you want to extend Vimperator,
you can easily do that by just dropping a JavaScript file in its plugin
directory. Browse through our [wiki]({{ site.data.links.wiki}}) pages for nice
tips to customize Vimperator and for
[frequently asked questions]({{ site.data.links.faq }}).
If you have more questions, you can visit us on IRC,
in #vimperator on [freenode](http://www.freenode.net/).

<b>NOTE:</b> Vimperator will stop functioning with Firefox 57!
</p>
<p>
Firefox 57 will change its add-on ecosystem to be exclusively based on <a
href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2016/11/23/add-ons-in-2017/">WebExtensions</a>.
While this offers (some) compatibility with extensions written for Chrome and
Microsoft Edge, it removes the possibility to do many advanced stuff which
Vimperator does. Additionally, it would require a full rewrite of Vimperator,
which nobody has volunteered for. Therefore we will stop supporting any Firefox
version later than Firefox 56. Head over to our GitHub page for <a

## Scripts

While Vimperator offers already lots of cool features,
we cannot and don't want to include every feature directly in the core.
Therefore a motivated group of hackers called [vimpr](http://vimpr.github.io/)
provides many enhancements for the Vimperator experience.
You can add [plugins](https://github.com/vimpr/vimperator-plugins) which add
new commands or mappings.
Install these plugins by copying them to the **~/.vimperator/plugin/**
directory (or **%HOME%\vimperator\plugin** on Windows) unless noted differently.

If you don't care about features but just use Vimperator for the sexy looks,
you can also theme that by using color schemes.
You can install them by copying them to the **~/.vimperator/colors/** directory
(**%HOME%\vimperator\colors** on Windows) and use it with `:colorscheme <name>`.

## Bugs

Unexpected features - sometimes also called bugs - are listed in our
[issue tracker](https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs/issues).
You can also file feature requests there.
