The fact that I can bind a macro to google for something without my hands leaving the keyboard. The fact that I can scroll, follow links, switch tabs, all without rodent interference. The fact that I can focus on an input field without using the rodent.  The fact that I can use terminal-like control keys for editing text fields (e.g., ctrl-D instead of reaching for the Del key, etc.). This last hasn't been that reliable because sometimes firefox has its own ideas about what should be interpreting keystrokes in input fields, but for the most part, it has been a boon.  Basically, the more my browser behaves like a glorified Vim, the more I like it.  The less my hands have to reach for the rodent, the happier I'll be.  I can't imagine life without Vimperator!","I will absolutely refuse to upgrade my browser unless I can be assured that there is a way to operate it without the rodent.
