# Muttator

**Muttator** is a free add-on for the
[Thunderbird]({{ site.data.links.thunderbird }}) mail client,
which makes it look and behave like the [Vim]({{ site.data.links.vim }})
text editor.
It has similar key bindings and you could call it a modal mail client,
as key bindings differ according to which mode you are in.
For example, the same key can select the next message while the message
list has focus or can scroll down an existing message when the message preview
is selected.
It also adds commands for accessing most Thunderbird functionality - e.g.
`:contact -firstname Martin -lastname Stubenschrott stubenschrott@vimperator.org`
will add a new contact with my details. 

But Muttator is more than just a simple command interface to Thunderbird —
it is a complete development environment as well.
If you are a web developer, you can enjoy an interactive JavaScript shell —
even with completion support.
Or if you want to extend Muttator,
you can easily do that by just dropping a JavaScript file in its plugin
directory. Browse through our [wiki]({{ site.data.links.wiki}}) pages for nice
tips to customize Vimperator and for
[frequently asked questions]({{ site.data.links.faq }}).
If you have more questions, you can visit us on IRC,
in #vimperator on [freenode](http://www.freenode.net/).

## Scripts

While Muttator offers already lots of cool features,
we cannot and don't want to include every feature directly in the core.
Therefore you can enhance the Muttator experience by adding plugins which add
new commands or mappings.
Install these plugins by copying them to the **~/.muttator/plugin/** directory
(or **%HOME%\muttator\plugin** on Windows) unless noted differently.

If you don't care about features but just use Muttator for the sexy looks,
you can also theme that by using color schemes.
You can install them by copying them to the **~/.muttator/colors/** directory
(**%HOME%\muttator\colors** on Windows) and use it with `:colorscheme <name>`.

## Bugs

Unexpected features - sometimes also called bugs - are listed in our
[issue tracker](https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs/issues).
You can also file feature requests there.
